# Design Choices
I have followed the standard folder structure which we use in Node JS projects. I have used promise based coding structure to handle asynchronous operations and utilized Async and await for making the code more readable and used try/catch for error handling. For APIs used RESTful API structure and added validations over API payload. For storing and retrieving data I have used mongodb atlas server.
